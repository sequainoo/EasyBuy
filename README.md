# EasyBuy (Phone shop)
---
EasyBuy is a platform where phones are sold. Customers are not expected to login to make a purchase.
After first purchase customer address information is kept and identified by the email uniquely.
So the next time after the purchase is not going to be a hustle.

The only payment information kept is the name on card, so customer should only worry about manually
entering the critical data.
